  s.description      = <<-DESC
Sticky allows developers to quickly and easily persist common Swift objects
without the overhead of a full persistence layer. Sticky leverages JSON
and the "Document" directory, along with the Codable protocol, for easy 
storage and access. Sticky is not intended for extremely large or highly 
transactional data sets, however, it does leverage caching to help with performance.
Sticky includes powerful features like built in notification center integration
for transaction events. It also includes a simple schema change management solution
as app data structure changes over the life of the app.
